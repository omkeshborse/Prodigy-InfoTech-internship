          <h1>Biography</h1>
          
          <p>
            Steve Jobs (1955-2011) was a true visionary, whose indomitable
            spirit and relentless pursuit of excellence revolutionized the world
            of technology and beyond. As the co-founder of Apple Inc., his
            impact on the tech industry and popular culture is immeasurable
          </p>
          <p>
            Born in San Francisco, California, Jobs displayed an early passion
            for electronics. Together with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, he
            founded Apple Computer in 1976, unveiling the Apple I and later the
            Apple II, setting the stage for personal computing.
          </p>
          <p>
            His journey was not without obstacles; he faced failure when ousted
            from Apple in 1985. However, Jobs refused to be defeated and went on
            to establish NeXT Computer and Pixar Animation Studios. Eventually,
            he returned to Apple in 1997, leading its miraculous turnaround.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under his visionary leadership, Apple introduced groundbreaking
            products that redefined technology, like the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and
            iPad. His keen eye for design and user experience elevated these
            devices to iconic status.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jobs' charisma and presentation skills were legendary, captivating
            audiences during his keynotes. His 'one more thing' moments became
            eagerly anticipated worldwide, adding excitement to product
            launches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond technology, Steve Jobs embodied creativity, daring to think
            differently and challenge the status quo. His famous quote, "Stay
            hungry, stay foolish," continues to inspire generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although he passed away in 2011, his legacy endures in the hearts of
            millions. Steve Jobs' contributions to the world will forever be
            remembered, and his vision will continue to shape our future. His
            spirit lives on, driving us to dream big, create fearlessly, and
            change the world for the better
